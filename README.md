# Diabetes-Prediction

Diabetes can be harmful to our health in many ways. It can damage our heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. But with the help of Data Science, we can manage the risk factors associated with diabetes. 
	By analyzing large amounts of information, Data Science can identify patterns and predict who is at a higher risk of developing diabetes. This enables us to take preventive measures, such as lifestyle changes or early treatment, to better manage and reduce the impact of diabetes on our bodies.

Using data science tools in prediction of diabetes is to analyze large amounts of patient data to identify patterns, risk factors. This helps healthcare professionals make accurate predictions and informed decisions for early intervention, prevention, and personalized treatment strategies.

Data science techniques can forecast disease progression and potential complications based on patient data. This helps healthcare providers proactively address risks & prevent complications.

Personalized treatment: By considering individual patient data, data science can help personalize diabetes treatment plans. It can identify optimal medication choices, lifestyle modifications, and interventions tailored to each patient's specific needs.

According to results we explore various classification algorithms. They achieved  accuracy up to 89%, 87.5%, 87% ,84% and 76.8% for Gradient Boosting ,  Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic regression model respectively. But the Gradient Boosting classification model got the highest accuracy for class 1results.

	In conclusion, our data science project successfully predicted the occurrence of diabetes. By analyzing various factors and patterns in the data, we were able to develop a model that can predict the diabetes in individuals more accurately. This project contributes to early detection and prevention of diabetes for all humanbeing
